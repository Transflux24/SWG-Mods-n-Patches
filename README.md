# SWG-Mods-n-Patches
Repo for patches and mini mods by myself for Star Wars Genesis Modlist. All credit goes to the original Modders and DeiryVengy for actually putting in work to make the mods, I simply patched them or make small tweaks.

For right now, to download the patches use the green <> Code button to download raw. I will reformat this to work by downloading releases soon, but for now this will do.

Please read all documents that come with this (the license is okay to skip lol), it will help save you frustration and I won't generally answer questions that are answered by reading the docs.
