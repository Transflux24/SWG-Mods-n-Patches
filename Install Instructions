Before continuing it is best practice to create a new Separator (or more if you want) to hold your added mods. When creating these separators, make sure to add "[DoNotDelete]" (without the ", so just [DoNotDelete])to the front of the separators name so Wabbajack wont delete them when the list updates (unless you dont care about that).

Also add "[DoNotDelete]" (without the ", so just [DoNotDelete]) to the front all your added mods names if you don't want Wabbajack to remove them when updating.

To install the mods, each one will be included in a zip archive. Simply install them manually through Mod Organizer 2 (no need to unzip them) by pressing the top left button just under File, and selecting the mods you want to install.

Load order will be explained for each mod in an included readme in the mods folder. After installing the mod, double click it in Mod Organizer 2 to learn where you should place this in the load order relative to SWG and other mods patched/made by me.
